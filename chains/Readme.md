# introduction

This repository contains a collection of chains that can be used to generate code and tests for a given task. The chains are implemented using the Langchain library.

# setup 
 Setup `.env` file with  `OPENAI_API_KEY="<key>"` 

 
# Use case
The example shown in this repository is a simple use case where we want to generate a code and a test for a given task. The task is to find the maximum number in a list. The code and test are generated by the chains.

output for first chain becomes input for second chain

i.e first chain generates code for a given task and the output is passed as input to the second chain which generates a test for the given task.
